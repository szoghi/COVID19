Open-source files to 3D print Fresno State face shields, masks with emergency FDA approval by Barrow Neurological, and emergency vent splitters and flow limiters.

We advise using 8.5"x14" transparency films and velcro to stick to the shield, along with an elastic strap to provide a comfortable way of securely mounting the shield. Plastic shield can be sanitized and reused.
