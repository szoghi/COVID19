# COVID19
Open-source files to 3D print Fresno State face shields, PAPR machines using retrofitted CPAP machines, masks with emergency FDA approval by Barrow Neurological, and emergency vent splitters and flow limiters.

We advise using 8.5"x14" transparency films and velcro to stick to the shield, along with an elastic strap to provide a comfortable way of securely mounting the shield assembly. Plastic shields can be sanitized and reused. They are designed to allow healthcare providers room to also wear googles and N95 masks.
