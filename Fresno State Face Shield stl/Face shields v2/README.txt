This version has a thickness of .09 inch verse .1 inch. For the printers we are using (mostly Ender3 and Ender5) we found that this took 
away a small crack in the middle of the band and actually made it stronger. 

If you are able to edit the Solidworks 2019 part file, you can create stacks of whatever size you desire by editing the linear pattern component.
Also, it is possible to suppress or delete the first extrude cute to remove the "FRESNO STATE" logo to save print time.
